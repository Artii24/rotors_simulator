Contributing
============

üëçüéâ Thanks a lot for considering contributing üéâüëç

We welcome and encourage contribution. There is many way to contribute: you can
write bug report, contribute code or documentation (please, take a look to the 
[Wiki section](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/wiki)).

## Reporting issues

When reporting issues the more information you can supply the better.

If it is an issue with building the code, indicate your environment (Indigo Igloo or Kinetic Kame versions of ROS)
like operating system (Ubuntu or MacOS).

## Improvements request and proposal

Feel free to make an issue to request a new functionality.

## Contributing code/Pull-Request

We welcome contribution, this can be done by starting a pull-request.
You can contribute by updating the ROS package content or styling, code, or both.

### Contributing content or styling

There is a couple of basic requirement for us to merge the pull request:
 - The pull request must pass the automated test (a TravisCI script will check if everythings is OK)

### Contributing code

If the change is big, typically if the change span to more than one file, consider starting an issue first to discuss the improvement.
This will makes it much easier to make the change fit well into the software.

There is some basic requirement for us to merge a pull request:
 - Describe the change (a bot will remind you in case you forget it)
 - Refer to any issues it effects
 - Separate one pull request per functionality: if you start writing "and" in the feature description consider if it could be 
 separated in two pull requests.
 - The pull request must pass the automated test (as described previously)

In your code:
 - Make sure the coding style of your code follows the style of the file (take a look at the [Developer Section](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/wiki#for-developers) into the first page of the CrazyS Wiki page).
